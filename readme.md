# MICO Custom Post Type: News (news_entry)
This is a very simple plugin, with the only purpose of adding a 
translation ready post type "News" to wordpress. 
We tend to need this post type on every other side we make at MICO, 
and this makes that process faster. Post types should always be registered in plugins anyway.

## A note about gramma
'News' as an english noun, does not have a singular form. 
A lot of other languages such as danish and spanish has a very clear difference between the singular and the plural form.
So in order to be as semantic as possible, this plugin adds the post type 'news_entry' in the database, and recomends 
translaters to translate in to their appropriate singular form instead. So 'Add News Entry' becomes 'Tilf√∏j Nyhed' in danish.


## Languages
So far this plugins comes with translations for
* danish
